    <string name="SkinTestResult">
        Allergy and Immunology\n
        Skin testing by means of a prick/puncture test with extracts of the suspected foods is also useful but mainly when the result is negative. Like skin testing for inhaled allergens, skin testing for food has a high sensitivity. If the result is negative, it is unlikely that a particular food, at least in the form that was used for testing, is the offending agent. By itself, a positive skin test is not diagnostic of food allergy unless the history independently suggests that this particular food has caused allergic symptoms. Skin testing can be used to narrow the choices of foods to be used for a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of ingestion.

    <string name="x_ray">
        Radiography is the imaging of body structures, or parts of the body, using X-rays. X-rays are a form of radiation (X-radiation) similar to visible light, radio waves and microwaves. X-radiation is special because it has a very high energy level that allows the X-ray beam to penetrate through the body and create an image or picture.
